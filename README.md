# FindWordLadders
in this assignment I was given a list of words.txt to populate a dictionary in Python. The goal was to find the amount of steps it would take to get from the start word to the end word by changing letters to fit words already in the list. If the word is not found there is an error message and if successful the program will print out each word in the ladder.
